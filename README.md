Battleship Game in Rust

This is a console-based implementation of the classic Battleship game in Rust. The game allows you to play against the computer in a turn-based battle to sink each other's ships.


Here's a brief overview of how the game works:

1. You and the computer have three ships placed on an 8x8 grid. 
2. Ships are represented by 'S' on the board. 'X' represents a hit, and 'O' represents a miss. 
3. Your Board: You'll see the current state of your own board, displaying your ships and any hits or misses.
4. Computer's Board: The computer's board is displayed, showing where the computer has made moves.
5. Your Turn: You'll be prompted to enter coordinates (row and column separated by space) to make a move. For example, you might enter something like "3 4" to target the cell at row 3, column 4.
6. Results: After your move, the game will inform you whether you've hit or missed the computer's ships.
7. Computer's Turn: The computer will then make a move, and the results will be displayed.
8. Repeat: The game continues with turns alternating between you and the computer until one side's ships are all sunk.
9. Winner: The game will declare a winner based on whether you or the computer sank all the opponent's ships.
10. Game end: The game ends when all of either your or the computer's ships are sunk. The winner is displayed at the end of the game.
